**how to define the path and run the code**  

**For none training approach**  
**Path define**: Absolute paths: Just  change all the folder path to the absolute path of the image folder  
**How to run**: run each cell sequentially  

**For training model approach**  
**Path define**: Relative paths: Code files and data folders are located in the same directory, and you can define these paths directly using relative paths, such as "train" and "test" in the example.  
**How to run**: run each cell sequentially
